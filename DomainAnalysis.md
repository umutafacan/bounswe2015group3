# General Information About the Domain #

Since their introduction, social network sites (SNSs) such as Myspace, Facebook, Cyworld, and Bebo have attracted millions of users, many of whom have integrated these sites into their daily practices. There are hundreds of social network sites, supporting a wide range of interests and practices.Most sites support the maintenance of preexisting social networks, but others help strangers connect based on shared interests, political views, or activities. Sites also vary in the extent to which they incorporate new information and communication tools, such as mobile connectivity, blogging, and photo-video sharing.

Social network sites are defined as web-based services that allow individuals to construct a public (some are semi-public according to the user)  profile within a bounded system, articulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection and  view and traverse their list of connections and those made by others within the system. The nature of these connections may vary from site to site. What makes social network sites unique is not that they allow individuals to meet strangers, but rather that they enable users to articulate and make visible their social networks. This can result in connections between individuals that would not otherwise be made and these meetings are frequently between those who share some offline connection. On many of the big social networking sites, participants are not necessarily networking or looking to meet new people. Instead, they are primarily communicating with people who are already a part of their extended social network.

# Customers and Users #

Users of this platform will be any member of the Computer Engineering Departmant at Bogazici University. This will include all the Computer Engineering students, faculty members, assistants, alumni and staff. Compared to most other social media platforms, this project will involve far fewer people since it is a closed platform.

# about.me ( http://about.me ) #
**Environment:** Web, iOS

_Tony Conrad - Co-founder of about.me_

> "We believe that you should own your own identity. That your identity should be both projected and protected. It should encompass the different facets of your life. It should be portable and universally accessible. And most importantly, it should be easy to create and manage." - http://about.me/about/us

### Similarities ###
about.me is a very similiar to our project.
  * It provides some space to people to describe themselves and get contacts.
  * It has very beautiful and user friendly interface.
  * You can prepare your profile page step by step, customize the theme, add contact etc.
  * Also it has moderate search system to find links to other people.

### Differences ###
  * The main difference between that site and ours is that about.me is "person oriented" system but we are planning "event or group oriented" one. In other words, at about.me, you can find a "person" who has the same interests with you but not a group.
  * Also you can not organize a event with the about.me's current properties. We differ from about.me that way.
So about.me is a good instance for us to consider what we should include and exclude as properties.

> It was a closed network for neighboors where they can meet or interact. For example, if there is a emergence case like break-in or medical issue, they can inform each other. Another usage is to organise meetings, parties or visitings with neighboors. Also, they may find person who has same interest or hobbies like football, gardening, mechanic etc. There may be helpful to talk to nextdoor boy/girl who fany each other.

### Similarities ###
  * It was basiccaly, similar to our system which improves communication among limited person.
  * System helps to get know each other who may see everyday but not talked yet.
  * And strengthening the collabaration makes a friendly, helpful and close community which aimed to also in our project.

### Differences ###
> However there are several differences from our system.
  * Firstly, its user audiance are neighboors but in ours, people in Boun Cmpe department.
  * Also in nextdoor.com any body can sign up although they can only contact with neighboors. In our project, users limited for department not even school.
  * They have difficult authentication method which need verify the address by giving credit card number or posting or home-line phone number. For our users just need to verify membership of department for example using  student number, email or departmental lists.
  * On the other hand, our system has a user roles such as student, TA, instructor,etc.. ,which are not used in nextdoor.com

![http://images.sodahead.com/polls/003735141/diaspora_logo_xlarge.png](http://images.sodahead.com/polls/003735141/diaspora_logo_xlarge.png)

Diaspora is a non-profit, user-owned, distributed social network. Diaspora consists of a group of independently owned nodes (called pods) which interoperate to form the network. Diaspora is not owned by any one person or entity.

### Similarities ###
  * Diaspora is similar to our project because it is place where people can meet and share their interests.
  * You can follow tags related to your interests.
  * Diaspora pioneered the concept of aspects, which means you can organise your contacts according to their role in your life. This means you can share something just with family members or work colleagues, knowing that no one you don’t want to will be able to see what you post.

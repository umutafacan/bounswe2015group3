# Introduction #

As with the WWW, the growth of the Semantic Web will be driven by applications that use it. Semantic search is an application of the Semantic Web to search. Search is both one of the most popular applications on the Web and an application with significant room for improvement. Semantic Search attempts to augment and improve traditional search results by using data from the Semantic Web. Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) technology is based almost purely on the occurrence of words in documents. Search engines like Google augment this in the context of the Web with information about the hyperlink structure of the Web. The availability of large amounts of structured, machine understandable information about a wide range of objects on the Semantic Web offers some opportunities for improving on traditional search.
There are 2 kinds of semantic searches:

**Navigational Searches**

**Research Searches**

**Navigational Searches**: In this class of searches, the user provides the search engine a phrase or combination of words which s/he expects to find in the documents. There is no straightforward, reasonable interpretation of these words as denoting a concept. In such cases, the user is using the search engine as a navigation tool to navigate to a particular intended document. We are not interested in this class of searches.

**Research Searches**:In many other cases, the user provides the search engine with a phrase which is intended to denote an object about which the user is trying to gather/research information. There is no particular document which the user knows about that s/he is trying to get to. Rather, the user is trying to locate a number of documents which together will give him/her the information s/he is trying to find. This is the class of searches we are interested in.

**Example**: A search query like "Sabo apple watch the truck'' does not denote any concept. The user is likely just trying to find the page containing all these words. On the other hand, search queries like "Eric Miller" or "Dublin Ohio", denote a person or a place. The user is likely doing an research search on the person or place denoted by the query. Semantic search attempts to improve the results of research searches in 2 ways.

As all innovative technologies, the Semantic Web underwent an evolution starting at research labs, being then picked up by the Open Source community, then by small and specialized startups and finally by business in general. Remember: the Web was originally developed in a High Energy Physics center!
At present, the Semantic Web is increasingly used by small and large business. Oracle, IBM, Adobe, Software AG, or Yahoo! are only some of the large corporations that have picked up this technology already and are selling tools as well as complete business solutions. Large application areas, like the Health Care and Life Sciences, look at the data integration possibilities of the Semantic Web as one of the technologies that might offer significant help in solving their Research&Development problems.

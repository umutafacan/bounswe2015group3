# What's in it for the organizers? #

  * **Quality software:** This is one of the most important aspects of crowdsourcing software. Organizers decide on specific goals that they want to achieve and because of the competent contestants, the task becomes not so hard to accomplish.
  * **Finding motivated talents:** A highly motivated crowd has other benefits as well. Organizers can pick the most motivated talent among many contestants.
  * **Diverse solutions:** The software becomes less error-prone because of the diversity among many groups working on the same project.

  * **Recognition:** Participating in a highly competent crowd, you get to stand out and be recognized if you demonstrate your abilities well.
  * **Financial rewards:** Often times there are financial rewards to the people who come up with a good solution to the problem.
  * **Educational rewards:** Even if people don't get any financial rewards, working on a difficult problem, along with a highly motivated group of people, helps educate them.

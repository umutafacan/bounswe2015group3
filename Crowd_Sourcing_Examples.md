# Examples of crowdsourcing #

# Introduction #

Many different types of crowdsourcing exist, helping organizations get work or funding from a large group of people at little-to-no cost to them.

# Kickstarter #

> Kickstarter is one popular option of crowdfunding, a type of crowdsourcing where individuals pledge money toward a proposed project idea that is at the concept or pre-production stage. Consumers are essentially paying for a product before it becomes available, giving many companies the revenue needed to bring an idea to fruition. While this does not always guarantee a finished product as companies may fail or revenue generated proves insufficient, Kickstarter projects leverage the trust of the consumer by providing increased levels of honesty and transparency.

# Wikipedia #

Wikipedia is another popular crowdsourcing medium. Editable by the public at large, the founding forces behind this online encyclopedia decided that rather than develop the entire websiteâ€™s content themselves, they would leverage the resources, passion and time of their audience to create content. As a result, Wikipedia has become one of the most comprehensive encyclopedia resources globally.

# Summary #
Crowdsourcing creates an avenue through which consumers can become more actively engaged in the work companies do. As the internet continues to bridge communication divides between consumers and businesses, crowdsourcing becomes ever a more prevalent resource to be utilized.

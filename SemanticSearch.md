# Introduction #

Semantic search seeks to improve search accuracy by understanding searcher intent and the contextual meaning of terms as they appear in the searchable dataspace, whether on the Web or within a closed system, to generate more relevant results.

# How does semantic search differ from _traditional_ search? #

Semantic search is a data searching technique in a which a search query aims to not only find keywords, but to determine the intent and contextual meaning of the the words a person is using for search. Semantic search provides more meaningful search results by evaluating and understanding the search phrase and finding the most relevant results in a website, database or any other data repository, whereas the _traditional_ search simply compares the keywords without considering their meanings and return results accordingly. The results given by traditional search need to be inspected by the requester (human user) to reach the part of information which is actually requested.

Semantic search can answer complex questions such as "What battles during the Civil War resulted in more than 1000 deaths?". _Traditional_ search merely answers the question "What documents (sources) discuss this battle?"

Another example can be given about the tagging of blog posts. Lets say a user creates a post about a farmer named Bill Gates and tags that post with string "Bill Gates". Assuming the density of word combination 'Bill Gates' is great enough, _traditional_ search includes this post in the result if a user requests to see the documents about Bill Gates, even if he meant Bill Gates, the famous Windows guy and not a farmer. Semantic search would not include that post in the results, as it does not fit the searcher intent.

# How does it work? #

Semantic search works on the principles of language semantics. Unlike typical search algorithms, semantic search is based on the context, substance, intent and concept of the searched phrase. Semantic search also incorporates location, synonyms of a term, current trends, word variations and other natural language elements as part of the search. Semantic search concepts are derived from various search algorithms and methodologies, including keyword-to-concept mapping, graph patterns and fuzzy logic.

# Introduction #

For the past few years, location of a mobile device has been determined by several ways such as GPS and Wi-Fi. However, GPS does not work indoors because indoor spaces often block cell signals. And the range can be very general. Sometimes it can find the location within hundreds of meters. Connecting to Wi-Fi also pinpoints device's location to the Wi-Fi hotspot position. Beacon technology is a solution for this problem.


Beacon is a technology based on location and uses Bluetooth. A device will emit passive signals and and our smart phones will receive messages which is mostly advertisement.

  * Main users of that technology will be soical media networks and their major customer target will be retail chains.

  * The hardware of the current smartphones is adaptable to that technology. It uses BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) and there is more than half billion device which is adaptable this issue. BLE is a wireless personal area network technology used for transmitting data over short distances. Compared to Classical Bluetooth, BLE provides low energy consumption and reduced cost while maintaining a similar communication range. BLE is an extremely power-efficient connection that does not drain the battery.

  * The system will be integrated with your personal records which collected in internet or real life. For example if you seached hard disks on internet, when you past next to a technology shop, you will receive a message that announce the discounts about hard disks.

  * The most important beacon concept is iBeacon, which is Apple's own version. Although it is an Apple's product, it also supports Android devices. The other important beacon producers are Paypal, Qualcomm, Estimote and Swirl.

# Introduction #

Android is becoming the standard operating system for the “Internet of things”. As a result,its importance and some main products of it have to be analyzed in detail.

**Why Android is really important in World of IoT ?**
  * There are a lot of devices run Android operating system and these devices provide a universal front end for anything that could call itself IoT.
  * Android applications especially mobile applications are everywhere.  These applications can definitely help making IoT devices useful.
  * Java is also big part of the World of IoT. It's difficult to dismiss Java wholesale, not just because of its existing base of deployment but also because of the reach and marketing muscle of Oracle. If IoT is going to be built on Java, then having Android to drive it means Java will be used even more. 

**Some Examples :**
> _Google Fit_
  * Google Fit is Google's new health initiative. It's a service that'll track all your health metrics -- sleep, steps, etc. -- and it's built into the next version of Android. But what does that mean? Well, it means that Google's Android platform is getting the same kind of life-metric tracking that Apple's iOS users are getting in iOS 8. More importantly, it means that the health devices you're already using will play nice with the many Android devices out there. It also means that all your health data ends up in one place, in one app, rather than spread across a variety of software applications.
> _Android Wear_
  * Android Wear is the platform for smartwatches designed to put the power of Google's Android onto your wrist. It keeps you always connected by delivering tailored alerts from your smartphone, but also acts as a point of input for interaction with your apps. It's designed to be simple, and is operated through a number of touch gestures, with a heavy reliance on voice control.
  * Android Wear runs through an app on smartphones, also called Android Wear. This manages the connection via Bluetooth with the Android device  as well as a range of device characteristics, such as how the  smartwatch behaves.
  * Android Wear brings a wearable user experience that's closely aligned with what's already offer from Google Now. That means voice-command interaction with your smartphone via your wrist - it's the bringing together of technology in a new format, and it has stacks of potential.
> _Android Auto_
  * Using Android Auto is a pretty great experience: it's simple, consistent, familiar and surprisingly responsive. Auto actually keeps up, unlike the tapping and waiting you do with many built-in navigation systems in modern cars. It seems to be only a hair laggier than using your phone directly, which is pretty impressive considering there's not a lot of processing going on in the car; all of the software and horsepower for Android Auto is piped over micro-USB from the phone itself

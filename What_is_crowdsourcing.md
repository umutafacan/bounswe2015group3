# What is Crowdsourcing? #

Crowdsourcing is the practice of engaging a ‘crowd’ or group for a common goal -- often innovation, problem solving, or efficiency. Crowdsourcing can take place on many different levels and across various industries. Thanks to our growing connectivity, it is now easier than ever for individuals to collectively contribute -- whether with ideas, time, expertise, or funds -- to a project or cause. This collective mobilization is crowdsourcing.

The Internet is now a melting pot of user-generated content from blogs to Wikipedia entries to YouTube videos. The distinction between producer and consumer is no longer such a prevalent distinction as everyone is equipped with the tools needed to create as well as consume.
As a business strategy, soliciting customer input isn’t new, and open source software has proven the productivity possible through a large group of individuals


# The history of crowdsourcing #

While the idea behind crowdsourcing isn’t new, its active use online as a business building strategy has only been around since 2006. The phrase was initially coined by Jeff Howe, where he described a world in which people outside of a company contribute work toward that project’s success. Video games have been utilizing crowdsourcing for many years through their beta invitation. Granting players early access to the game, studios request only that these passionate gamers report bugs and issues with gameplay as they encounter before the finished product is released for sale and distribution.
Companies utilize crowdsourcing not only in a research and development capacity, but also to simply get help from anyone for anything, whether it’s word-of-mouth marketing, creating content or giving feedback.


# The benefits of crowdsourcing #

Crowdsourcing is a powerful business marketing tool as it allows an organization to leverage the creativity and resources of its own audience in promoting and growing the company for free. From designing marketing campaigns to researching new products to solving difficult business roadblocks, an organization’s consumers can likely provide important guidance and answers. And, best of all, all the consumer wants in return for their opinion and effort is some recognition or even a simple reward.
Crowdsourcing increases the productivity of a company while minimizing labor expenses. The Internet is a time-proven strategy for soliciting feedback from an active and passionate consumer base. Customers today want to be involved in the companies they buy from, which makes crowdsourcing an incredibly effective tool.

# What is Crowdsourcing Creative Work? #

Crowdsourcing creative work is assigning a creative task to the general public. The creative task can be anything including music, architecture, graphic design etc. This is usually done to increase the diversity in solutions and increase the number of supplies.


# What's in it? #

Crowdsourcing brings people together to socialize, compete and create good results. People do this in order to get an award, or just to educate themselves, or just to make a good product. There are numerous situations where people don't get any money, but still do the job. Due to the improvements in technology, crowdsourcing is usually done online, but this is not a necessity.

However, there are some criticism to this topic because of the ambiguity of payment. People are expected to work regardless of the fact that they are getting paid or not.

# Arcbazar: An Example #

Arcbazar is the first and largest global marketplace for crowdsourcing architecture projects. Clients who need architectural work post their needs and contestants submit their designs for the project. Despite its success and its popularity among popular media, it is heavily criticized by professional media.
